The 2024-2025 Executive Officership of Open Source Club, its pursuit to sharpen the goals
and functions of the organization, has decided to privately archive many of the
years-out-of-date git repositories headed by former Executive Officers, largely with the
motivation of making the GitHub organization simpler to navigate. However, the Executive
Officership also recognizes the value in detailed record keeping and transparency of former
processes. Thus, we provide all of the now-archived repositories as downloadable and
browsable compressions of source code for any and all to peruse.

This repository is not licensed unto itself; each repository contained herein comes
attached with its own license.

This is **not** an actively used repository. It is only used for record keeping, hence why
it has been archived so soon after creation.
